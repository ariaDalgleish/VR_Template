--- Completely re-ripped by Slipsy! ---


- Added missing invuln textures, corrected wrong eye textures and added alternate eye textures, in-game and HWM face textures, ice and gold statue effects.

- Added both in-game and HWM models, each with blendshapes. In-game model has simple speech visemes and expressions, while the HWM model has more in-depth individual facial flexes.

- Gibs! Boom!
